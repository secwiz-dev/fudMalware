Modular C persistent payload
Project I've started to better understand the inner workings of malware. 
Futrue plans are to create a bunch of modular chunks of code and have them called
as necessary to further obfuscate and reduce footprint. Also will be implementing a 
crypter soon, schools out for summer so I've got a little time.
